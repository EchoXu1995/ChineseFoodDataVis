                <p>China is a country with frequent disasters due to its unique geographical environment. Droughts, locusts, earthquakes, and the following famines make it necessary to use every resource. After overcoming the famine, many eating habits had been preserved and become traditions.</p>

                <p>Historically, most Chinese supreme rulers employed ancient philosophies (mainly Confucianism) as their guidelines to rule the country instead of relying on a single religion. Although there have been religious taboos, such taboos have never resulted in mandatory legislation. Relatively free from taboos and avoidances, Chinese people dare to taste different foods.</p>
